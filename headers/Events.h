  \brief Set the system event mask

  <pre>SetEventMask sets the low-level mask used by the system to determine
which events it should post to the event queue.
eventMask is a 16-bit binary mask describing which events to include or
exclude. The normal value is 0xFFEF (which excludes only keyUp
events). Use eventMask =everyEvent (defined in Events.h as 0xFFFF)
to include all events. See Event Mask for named constants you can
use in this value.
</pre>
* \returns <pre>none
</pre>
* \note <pre>The preferred way to access the system event mask is by reading or storing
the global variable SysEvtMask (at 0x0144).
Indiscriminately changing this mask can cause problems. The only
legitimate use is to allow enqueuing of keyUp events, i.e.:
SetEventMask ( everyEvent ); // or SysEvtMask |= keyUpMask
Applications making this call during initialization must save the event
mask prior to calling SetEventMask and restore the event mask when
quitting.
If, under Finder, an application fails to restore the event mask before
quitting and it was set to mask out mouseUp events, all mouseUp events
would continue to be masked out. The user would then notice that the Finder
no longer recognizes double clicks. There are other anomalies associated
with MultiFinder ; to get a summary of these see the entry
About MultiFinder .

  <pre>PPostEvent works like PostEvent (it stores an entry into the
event queue) except that it returns, via its third parameter, the physical
address of the stored queue element. This provides access so you can modify the
contents of that element.
eventWhat specifies which type of event should be posted. It should be one of
the event types listed in GetNextEvent .
eventMsg specifies the value to be placed in the message field of the
EventRecord . It should correspond in type to the meaning of
eventWhat .
qElPtris the address of an EvQElPtr . Upon return, it contains the address
of a 22-byte evQEl structure. See Notes, below for an example of
how to access that record.
</pre>
* \returns <pre>an Error Code . The following are possible:
noErr(0)worked without error
evtNotEnb (1)eventWhat  is currently disabled. See SetEventMask
</pre>
* \note <pre>The less-flexible PostEvent function lets you specify values for only two
of the five EventRecord fields. By using PPostEvent , you can follow up by
changing the where, when, and modifiers fields.
For instance, you could use PPostEvent to enqueue a command-key
shifted mouseDown event with selected coordinates as follows:
EvQEl*myQElPtr;
PPostEvent ( mouseDown , 0, &myQElPtr );
myQElPtr-> evtQModifiers = cmdKey;
SetPt( &(myQElPtr->evtQWhere), 100,100);
See EvQEl for the layout of event queue elements.
It is also possible to build a queue element from scratch and use Enqueue
to insert it into the event queue. See GetEvQHdr .

</pre>
* \note <pre>PostEvent creates the EventRecord using the current time, modifiers ,
and mouse position. If you need to control these values, you may have to
modify the queue itself. See PPostEvent for a way to alter the EventRecord
after it is enqueued and see GetEvQHdr for additional information.
It is probably unwise to post window update and activate events ( updateEvt
or activateEvt ) since these are actually generated by the Event Manager
at the time of the GetNextEvent request, and are never actually stored in
the queue.
An example of usage might be to post a menu-changing event. For instance,
define an app3Evt to be one that causes a window name to be added or
removed from your application's Window menu. You could use
PostEvent (app3Evt, windowID ) whenever the user opens or closes a
document window. That way, you can handle all window-related menu
manipulation as a function of your main event loop . Note: This is not
necessarily a better way to do it, just an alternative.

/**
\brief Used internally by Event Manager

<pre>SystemEvent is called by the Event Manager as a way to watch for certain
events and pass some of them directly to DAs, without bothering your
application. This function should not be called by applications.
theEvent is the address of a 16-byte EventRecord . It contains information
received from a previous call to GetNextEvent .
</pre>
* \returns <pre>A Boolean; it identifies whether the event should be handled by an
application or a DA. It is one of:
FALSE (0)This event should be passed to the application. It may be a
system event the application should handle by calling
SystemClick .
TRUE (1)This event should be handled by the system (i.e., a DA). It will
not be forwarded to the application.
</pre>
* \note <pre>SystemEvent is called internally by the GetNextEvent function. The
idea is to avoid clogging up your event loop; let the system handle such
events as keystrokes, mouse-ups, updates, and activate events occuring in a
DA window.
If you want to get a look at all events, you can store a 0 in the 1-byte
global variable SEvtEnb (at 0x015c). This will cause GetNextEvent to
forward all unmasked events to you.
When a DA creates a window (including a modeless dialog) it must set the
windowKind to its refnum, which is a negative number. When the
application calls GetNextEvent , as explained above, the Event Manager
calls SystemEvent . If it returns TRUE then your DA gets the event. Since
your window is a modeless dialog you would call IsDialogEvent , which
returns FALSE What is going on is that IsDialogEvent (like
SystemEvent) checks the windowKind looking for a value of 2 (for
dialogs). Since your dialog's windowKind is a negative number, the DA's
refnum, IsDialogEvent does nothing. The solution is to change the
windowKind of your window to 2 before calling IsDialogEvent . This
allows the Dialog Manager to recognize and handle the event properly. Be
sure to restore the windowKind to its former value before returning to
SystemEvent . That way, when the application calls the Dialog Manager
with the same event (it should pass all events to the Dialog Manager if it has
any modeless dialogs), the Dialog Manager will ignore it.
